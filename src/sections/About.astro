      <p>
        I would describe myself as someone with a keen eye for design and a
        genuine passion for delivering exceptional user experiences. With years
        of experience in the industry, I have honed my skills in crafting
        intuitive and visually appealing web applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        My ability to empathize with users and understand their needs allows me
        to design interfaces that are both visually appealing and highly
        intuitive. My journey as a frontend developer began at my first
        programming job working on a design system at <a href="#work">Metso</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        My eagerness to learn and my <a href="#education"
          >comprehensive educational background</a
        > allow me to quickly pick up new languages, technologies, and practices.
        For this portfolio page I wanted to learn something new, and so I created
        it using Astro and Svelte, two bleeding-edge frontend/web frameworks that were
        good fits for this use case.
